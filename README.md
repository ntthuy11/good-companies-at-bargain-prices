This code repo is an implementation of [The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470624159).

Quick notes:

- The author of the book, [Joel Greenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Greenblatt), does not provide source codes or actual sources of the data he is using for the [Magic Formula Investing](https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/) website. 

- My implementation is based on free data of [NASDAQ screener](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener) with [NASDAQ API](https://api.nasdaq.com/api/screener/stocks) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). So my final result could be a bit different from Greenblatt's.
